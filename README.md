PSREC
=====

psrec is a stand-alone (at least for recording) command line application designed for recording basic aspects of other applications that are run, currently CPU usage and memory usage over time.

It's essentially a compiled (using Rust) application very similar in use-case to psrecord.

Currently visualisation of the data needs to be done externally, but it can save the results to a .CSV file.
